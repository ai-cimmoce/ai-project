# Noise pollution forecasting

This is my ideas of Building AI course project

## Summary

Noise has been found to cause a lot of health problems, especially in cities. Predicting the frequency and intensity of noise using AI, like weather forecasts, could help people avoid times when there is a lot of noise pollution "in the air."


## Background

There have been many studies on the health effects of noise. It has been found to cause health problems, especially when exposure to noise is constant. Predicting noise dosage using AI would help people avoid areas or times when they are likely to be exposed to the adverse effects of noise. A "sound pollution forecast" would be useful in a personal and also in an economic sense.

## How is it used?

There is already a workable solution for continuous measurement of noise on a personal level. Almost everyone now has a device in their pocket with which personal noise exposure can be measured. Mobile phones. With the collected volume data, location data and time data, the application could create its own personal noise pollution forecast for each, for example, for the next three days.


## Data sources and AI methods
The collection of personal voice data could be done on cell phones. On a larger scale, sensors could be easily installed in cities to create, for example, a noise pollution-API whose data could be used by application developers. 

Natural phenomena also cause noise pollution. Is it possible to obtain sound data from the sound pollution of weather phenomena, for example from the Finnish Meteorological Institute? Or would it be possible to use sound pollution data in weather forecasts ?!
